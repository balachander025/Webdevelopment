    <p> <b> Anita O'Day </b> 
        Anita O'Day (born Anita Belle Colton; October 18, 1919-November 23, 2006) was an American jazz singer widely
        admired for her sense of rhythm and dynamics, and her early big band appearances that shattered the traditional
        image of the "girl singer". Refusing to pander to any female stereotype, O'Day presented herself as a "hip" jazz
        musician, wearing a band jacket and skirt as opposed to an evening gown. She changed her surname from Colton to
        O'Day, pig Latin for "dough," slang for money.

        Style
        O'Day, along with Mel Tormé, is often grouped with the West Coast cool school of jazz. Like Tormé, O'Day had
        some training in jazz drums (courtesy of her first husband Don Carter); her longest musical collaboration was
        with jazz drummer John Poole. While maintaining a central core of hard swing, O'Day's skills in improvisation of
        rhythm and melody put her squarely among the pioneers of bebop.
        She cited Martha Raye as the primary influence on her vocal style, also expressing admiration for Mildred
        Bailey, Ella Fitzgerald, and Billie Holiday. She always maintained that the accidental excision of her uvula
        during a childhood tonsillectomy left her incapable of vibrato, and unable to maintain long phrases. That
        botched operation, she claimed, forced her to develop a more percussive style based on short notes and rhythmic
        drive. However, when she was in good voice she could stretch long notes with strong crescendos and a telescoping
        vibrato, e.g. her live version of "Sweet Georgia Brown" at the 1958 Newport Jazz Festival, captured in Bert
        Stern's film Jazz on a Summer's Day.</p>
